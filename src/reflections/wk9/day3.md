# Scrum for Small teams

---

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

Meetings need to be streamlined so that the smaller team can still have the time needed in order to meet deadlines. Stakeholders might need to make compromises on timelines or features (see the unattainable triangle). Sprints might need to be multi functional, and team members might need to stretch themselves in order to help the team meet the requirements that the project needs.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

This whole question is essentially tied up in not overloading your team with too much work. You have one sprint, you narrow down the drawbacks to the unattainbable triangle. Give the team an attainable, timely goal, and let them do their thing. Do this multiple times. Don't overlaod your team with too much, let them get one sprint out of the way at a time and then you have a relatively quick timeframe for the workload that's done well. boom. Not always the case, but it takes care of quite a few edge cases.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

To quote the article: 

"Good service Cheap won't be Fast

Good service Fast won't be Cheap

Fast service Cheap won't be Good"

In scrum, they strive to minimize the downsides of each side. See the above question for the reasoning on this.
