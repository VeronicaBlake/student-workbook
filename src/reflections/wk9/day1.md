## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We've been sticking to a morning sprint/afternoon sprint and an end of the day retroactive pretty strictly, which has been working out well. We've been using partnering programming as well, and finding the timing for that has been interesting. For me it' about every 90 minutes, but I know some people like to go longer. We should have figured out a way to split the postman duties, but that's okay. We're all logged in and have the token on the branches we're making.

## What went well so far?

So far our partnered programming, morning stand ups, and retrospectives have been going well. Having the project owner and the big retrospective on Tuesday was good, we just need a firm direction to move forward without the project owner adding to the MVP. If you can't tell we had some control issues in our group, but by Friday we got a pretty solid groove going.

## What would you do differently? Why?

If I could do it all over again, I would choose to put some of the more ambitious team members on their own projects from the very beginning. Some of us needed to review vue from the ground up, some of us were ready to do the entire project by themselves, and some of us were in the middle. I would have sat down and essentially waterfalled every step of the process that needed to be made, and then had everyone sign off on what they were going to do, and then made sure that each step was documented when done. Just more organization and documentation.
