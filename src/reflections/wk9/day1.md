## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We used a lot of partnered programming and scrum. As far as tecnhologies, we used a many to many relationship, which was a difficult system to work with, especially with Node. We started with user stories as well to determine the roles that we would need to write pathways and functions for.

## What went well so far/ What would you do differently? Why?

I think that all the planning we did was a really good move. By figuring out the arcitecture in the back end, we were able to make the models, and then determine what functions are needed between the different models. 

We actually should have all sat down and made a map of the functions that would be needed by what in the back end. We sort of did that, but with sticky notes and no visual correlation. The physical mapping was really helpful (even though it was through figma and not actually physical, but I digress). 

SCRUM at the beginning and end of the day was also a really good move. We were able to volunteer for things that we wanted to to as well, which was really cool. Partnered programming and a floater was a nice way to go about working with a team of five, and I think if we had broken into teams and explicitly outlined who was doing what for the entirety of the project, we would have avoided some confusion and merge conflicts. 

Interpersonally I think we were functioning and got along well for the most part. Communication was the best tool we had for that, and it's a lifelong skill that we'll all have to keep practicing. But I would work with this group again! I'm proud of what we created, and I feel like I got to play a large part in it this time.
