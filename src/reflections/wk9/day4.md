## What is an SSL certificate?

As the article refers to SSL Certificates as  "small data files that cryptographically establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser." Essentially these are like a bunch of tiny bouncers that take the personal infomation being served, section it up, and transport in it armored cars to a secure secondary location where they all start communicating in code. That's a roundabout way to say that they create an encrypted connection between their site and your server.
