## What is a Github action and how do they work?

Github actions are a way to automate tasks. You create actions in your repositories by creating one or more text files, called workflows. They are made up of YAML files.

## What benefits do Github actions provide?

Github Actions allow for the creation of custom lifecycle workflows that trigger automatically. This allows for automation, which can help with testing, and reduce the amount of work that the dev needs to do when testing. Automation is nifty.
