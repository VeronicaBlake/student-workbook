## In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Columns contain the column name, data type, and any other specifics the column needs. Rows have the data for a specific instance (or one object) of the data.

## Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id.

 CREATE TABLE characters(
--    id int(255) NOT NULL,
--    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
--    age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
--    description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
--    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

## What is the difference between the following statements:

DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

Delete From table deletes an item from the table, Drop Table deletes the entire table. Don't drop the table. (don't. drop. that sql table ayyy don't drop that sql table)
