# C# Enums

## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An enum is a way to assign a word to an integral value. You would use them when you want to refer to a set of data that has integral values currently assigned to them, but it's better for you to be able to reference a word. Things like days of the week, months, cardinal directions, etc. It makes the coding bits that require math and numbers easy on the computer, and easy on your brain.

## How can you modify an Enum?

You can modify an enum by changing its base type and member values from an int to another data type (byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, and ulong). You can also change the value of an enum member from its default.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I know we've assigned certain things to be enums in our afternoon projects, specifically when the data type of an object might be changing or referred to in a couple of different ways. I remember making a note about enums, saying that "this is used when the data type doesn't really matter", and I can see that's not the best way to describe what enums do. A better way to phrase that would be "this is used when the data type might not be solid for the entire project".
