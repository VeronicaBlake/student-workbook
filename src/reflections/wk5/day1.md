Query strings allow you to pass information to and from a website by appending to the URL.

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

a query parameter goes like "?key=value". They are separated by an ampersand if there are multiples back to back.

## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Query parameters are useful when you're making a search bar, or searching for something specific in your data. I forsee a situation where you're trying to search by tags or something and the query parameter can find specifics for you.
