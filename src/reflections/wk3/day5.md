## Day 1

The start of week three, again. If I'm remembering correctly, this week sucks. Just because of the learning curve. It's important information that will be used for the rest of the course, but it's difficult to grasp. I should have watched more of the videos over the break, and I'm kicking myself for not giving myself time to absorb the information at a leisurely pace. Ah, life.

## Day 2

We started the MVCS model today, and most people are kind of freaking, like they did last time, which is to be expected. I didn't expect that I would have issues on the vending machine app. I got relatively far, but there are still some things that I'm shaky on. For instance, how do you access items from a dictionary when writing a function in MVCS? Do you write it in Appstate and then just have to say 'proxystate.blah.blahblahblah' when writing the function in the server? That might actually be how you do it.

I might request a tutoring session to go over some specific functions. I should have asked for more help today, but I get embarassed sometimes with the questions I have to ask. No one's made me feel bad about asking them, I just get down on myself for forgetting everything. It's got me wondering what I actually knew in the first place. And I'm fighting with my best friend, so that's been heavy on my mind and sucked up a good part of the afternoon. Hopefully I can get some sleep tonight and do better in the morning.
