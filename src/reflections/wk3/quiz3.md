# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?

```
Encapsulation- Removing access to parts of your code and making things private
Abstraction- Hiding the implementation details inside something
Polymorphism- Types in the same inheritance chains being able to do different things
Inheritance- lets one object acquire the properties and methods of another object

```

**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?

```

I was a dummy and must have deleted the example of this problem last time I did this journal.

```

```


```

**3.** What is Encapsulation?

```
Encapsulation is when parts of an app that go together are written in a way that allows them to reach outside of the scope they are in, but prevents

```

**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?

```
S stands for 'single use'.

```

**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?

```
A class is like the qualifications that an object needs in order to be considered a part of the class, and an instance of class is the specific object that we're talking about. The idea of a chair vs an armchair. But in code.

```

**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?

```

A proxy object is like a photocopy of the object that it's standing in as proxy for. It allows us to manipulate the data in use without deleting or altering the 'pure' data in storage so that the original is maintained.

```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?

```
The MVC pattern is a standardization pattern in programming that allows developers to know where to look for what inside of an application. It makes it easier to read other's code.

```

**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?

```

The controller formats data for the server to use in its logic. It also speaks to the client facing sides of the application.

```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?

```

The service handles the logic and the action in an app. This is where the functions are actually written.


```

**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?

```
The model is where an object is defined.
