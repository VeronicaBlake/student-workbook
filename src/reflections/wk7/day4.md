# Partnered Programming Review

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We implemented some code documentation and used the driver/navigator roles pretty heavily. Having the driver and navigator was a good way to edit code and catch typos so that things didn't break for frustrating reasons like a misspelled word or a missing semicolon.

## What went well?

Having two heads is definitely better than one when it comes to solving problems and talking through code. I think that we did a really good job puzzling though issues that we had, and having two different backlogs of resources to pull from was good. 

Our broad planning was good as well, I think that we structured the back end and our models in a way we were able to work with later.

## What would you do differently?

I think that I would advocate for daily planning, figuring out where we want to be at the end of the day or before/after breaks so that there was no need to work outside of the designated time. Granted the scope of this project was pretty large, so that might have been an inevitability. I think implementing a sprint pattern would have been very helpful.
