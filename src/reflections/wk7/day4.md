# Partnered Programming Review



## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We tried to do some documentation, not following the format mentioned in the reading because we were cruising along and it was pretty time consuming, but that is definitely something that I'm going to advocate for doing moving forward in any collaboration with a team. (I might ven try it out myself in projects just for me.) As far as partnered programming goes, we did a pretty good job on the first day of switching off, but when you have a large skill disparity it can be difficult to get the pacing down correctly. And we had a group of three, with one of us being remote. However, we spent the majority of the last day focusing on the user experience, which I hecking love. It's like coding and visual rhetoric all bundled into one and it's great.

## What went well?

I really liked the aspect of talking out the backed relationships, frontend logic, and design with a team of people I enjoy working with. I feel that talking, stopping frequently, asking questions and having discussions was good for our app, and good for us as computer programmers. 

I also really enjoyed driving, becuase that made me feel like I was getting actual practice and borrowing someone else's brain. I think that writing and naming functions went well, as well as having someone else to proofread and catch small mistakes that others had made was great too. All in all, this was an enjoyable experience.

## What would you do differently?

I think I would have advocated for myself more. We did a pretty good job on the first day of switching off, but when you have a large skill disparity (like we did) it can be difficult to get the pacing down correctly. And we had a group of three, with one of us being remote. It was a difficult setup before that was thrown into it. Advocating and telling others to slow down if I need it is something I need to get better at, as it's thrown me off multiple times, even just in this course. As a woman in a male-dominated industry, it's hard to be assertive. Even little things like "hey, you've been driving for a while, mind if I take over?" Or "I would really appreciate it if we could all troubleshoot this bug together tomorrow instead of one person individually overnight" are hard for me to say. It's just something I'll have to work on. And I would have liked to put in much more documentation.
