## What are some benefits of Code Documentation??

## How important is Code documentation and why?

 Code documentation is very important to future you and your collaborators. The argument made in the article (which I agree with wholeheartedly) is that documentation sort of functions as the translator between our human, English speaking brains and the machine that reads code. I think that's a good eay to look at it, the documentation is there to put the code into English so we don't have to.
