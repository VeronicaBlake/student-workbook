# Pair Programming


## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when two developers use the same computer to look at/write the same code. Both parties must be actively involved in the coding process, or you're gonna have a bad time. This works best when you're programming out loud, a running commentary should be made.

One person is the "driver"- this is the one who is using the keyboard and physically writing the code. 
The other is the "navigator" - this person is still actively involved in the code writing but more focused on over all direction.

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
The code is expected to be better, as there are two people troubleshooting it, the weaker developer will learn by watching a more experienced developer work, there are less distractions as one person can address external stimuli and let the other person work, and coordination in large groups becomes easier as there are half as many groups to manage when they're all paired up.

## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

If the two developers don't work well together, or don't like each other for whatever reason, or one smells bad or something, there might be butting of heads that can impede progress over the code. Two people means that there will be disagreements occasionally, and those need to be sorted out. Partner programming also requires a particular setup, so you can't just do it comfortably or efficiently anywhere.
