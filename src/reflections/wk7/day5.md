# Freestyle


## Day 1


## Day 2
I live in constant fear of this two strike checkpoint that's coming up. I feel like I'm incapable of moving forward by myself. I keep thinking that maybe other people are the best resource, but what happens if I have a job and constantly need help or validation? Is that a personal problem? The second day of the checkpoint went well, talking things out with Sam and Jared make things much easier. But I kind of feel like it's mostly Sam doing the heavy lifting.
