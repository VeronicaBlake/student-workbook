## How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Inheritance allows us to create new classes that can reuse and add on to their base classes. A class that is derived from a base class inherits all heritable members of the base class.

## How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Accessibility determies whether or not members of a base class are visible. If a member is marked private, it won't be visible from a child class. Protected members are only visible in child classes, and public members are part of the public interface.
