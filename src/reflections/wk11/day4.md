# Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.


Oh man. This has been such an enriching experience to go through this course again. i'm finally reaching the point where things are new, and I've already gotten much farther than I had the first time. It feels good. I have confidence that with help and reference, I can do this. Words will never express the gratitude that I have at the opportunity that I have been given through doing this course again. I am such a better developer than I was even three months ago. People say that development is like learning a new language, and I wholeheartedly agree. Being able to feel like you can speak/read it is such an amazing feeling. I could go on, and most likely will when I have more time. 

Time management is such an issue for me, and always has been. This is an opportunity for me to implement the tools that I've been given, like timeboxing, planning, daily standups and sprints with myself. Backend will be a little easier as I can deffer to the postman tests, but front end is a little trickier. Thankfully, there are the requirements that I can use as a touchstone for that. 

I think that the real certificate of completion was the friends I made along the way. Or something like that. I still want the certificate. But in all seriousness, the people that I've met and the friends I've made still remain a hilight. That, and the feeling that I'm doing something for myself, and that I can learn difficult things and do hard stuff. It is not a fluke that I've made it this far. I just need a bit more time to pick up on things, I think. 

This is without a doubt the hardest thing I've ever done, and I'm ready to move forward and finish it.
