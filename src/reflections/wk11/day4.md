# Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.


Oh man, this prompt is like, asking me to summarize the entirety of my codeworks experience. That's hardcore, and I'm probably going to get emotional. I have a lot of concerns about time management, but I think that I can timebox out issues that I might be having, and if I can hold little mini sprints with myself and set goals I think I'll be okay. 

I've never really been good at doing that, but I'm going to do something bold I don't do very often: try. This final is stressing the heck out of me though. I'm concerned that I won't be able to focus up enough or code fast enough to pass the final, which is making it worse because then I get all anxious and don't code as well as I know I can because I'm anxious. It's a vicious cycle. But I just need to keep reminding myself that I do know what I'm doing, and I'm capable of doing the work that comes with figuring it out.
