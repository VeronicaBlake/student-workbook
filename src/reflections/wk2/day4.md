## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
I was thinking about this before reading this article actually, I think the best comparison for coding without making a plan first is trying to write an essay without an outline. You wind up trying to pass off a rough draft as a final draft in both cases. Also, with a plan already thought out, there is no sitting around and staring at your code, thinking "what do I do now?" and waiting for the sweet embrace of inspiration or death, whichever comes first. A plan is easy to adapt to challenges that arise, instead of constantly flying by the seat of your pants.

##  How do you find answers when you are stuck?
I usually go to someone else, like an instructor or friend, or the internet. If none of these resources are available, I tend to just bash my head against problems until they're solved. Although recently I found that explaining the logic of my code to my husband was really helpful in finding where the problem was. 

I find the best thing to do is to find someone who knows better than I do, and ask them the right questions. Granted, sometimes the right questions take a couple of questions to get to them first. Talking to someone and addressing my specific concerns with another head is really useful. Maybe I should invest in a rubber duck.

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
For me, it's the "don't take too much time planning out your code."  I tend to want to take forever making sure the outline is absolutely perfect, and that has been to my determent many, many times. I run out of time and momentum to do the stuff that actually needs to get done, like thinking critically and, like, solving the problem that's been given to me. Just make a rough plan, and then follow your heart, dog. 

Also, not having an entire road map laid out before starting, just main checkpoints to achieve in small steps that are subject to change. For something that seems very logic-centric, programming is a largely an exercise in creativity and adaptability with an insanely large amount of resources at your disposal. Thinking in programmer is a skill, and it's exhausting at times. 

Also this quote "Do not dance around problems. Face your realities." Because hot dog. That's some tough love and a needed dose of reality at times. 

Also, there is a lot to learn when you're starting. It's okay if you don't learn all of it at once, but as long as you always have the desire to learn something, you're doing okay. It takes time and practice, and if you devote those to coding, you can get it in time.
