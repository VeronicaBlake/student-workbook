# The Mistakes I Made As a Beginner Programmer

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

This allows you to think through the logic of the code before you get into the nitty gritty of the functions and parameters and async stuff and all those good things. It's like making an outline for an essay before you start writing sentences. It allows you to organize your thoughts and gives you a road map to follow.

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?

You gotta google that junk. Someone, somewhere has had a comparable question and you will find something helpful online.

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

I really like this quote:

    "Do not think about programming as writing lines of code. Programming is a logic-based creativity that needs nurturing."

There isn't one right way to code something (there are a bunch of wrong ways but that's beside the point.), and this is a great takeaway for someone who just wants to find a solution and be done with it. I've been working on finding joy in the process, and a large part of that is giving myself adequate time to do that. It takes trial and error, as well as planning and researching and problem solving to make something good. My biggest takeaway from this is to take time to enjoy the process, and to delight in the progress that I've made.
