## Day 3

Ok so I didn't get to freewriting for Monday and Tuesday, which is fine but disappointing. I had family in town so this week has been kind of packed, which I don't like. I need to keep my discipline up so that I don't fall behind. It's just a little bit of work every day, I can do that. I _can_ do that. Have to keep telling myself that I can do these things and I'm good at them (or at least that I'm getting better every day.)

We made rock, paper, scissors today, and I'm really excited about the way that I made it. I used the approach that Mark used today in lecture so that nothing is really hard coded, except for the objects, not even the buttons. I got the rock, paper and scissors, and then was able to add spock and a lizard by only adding the spock and lizard objects. ...I think I'm going to try the 25 option variant. That might take a minute to write the objects but it's so much faster than hard coding it.
