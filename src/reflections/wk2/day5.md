# Day 5 Freestyle 

-I feel like I know both a good amount of information and absolutely nothing at the same time.
-I go back and forth between feeling like I have an aptitude for this and feeling like I really suck at this.
- I worry myself a little bit because I didn't muscle through and make my checkpoint do exactly what I wanted it to do because it seemed like it was going to be a lot of work. Maybe this is just something that I need to realize and combat in myself.
-Still feel like I don't really know a whole lot about HTML/CSS or JS. But I can make a button feed a doughnut to a dinosaur so that's cute.
