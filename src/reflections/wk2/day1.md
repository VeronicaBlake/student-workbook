# Var, let and const
https://github.com/VeronicaBlake/js-tests-basics

## What is scope?

Scope is where the variables are available for use within/outside of functions.

## What is hoisting?

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

I don't think many people (except maybe those really proficient in JavaScript who have been using var before let and const came out) use var to declare variables, because the variable is created before it's defined. 

You might use const instead of let when you would like a variable to never change. It is a constant after all!
