## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

You can write things directly from the console using the console tab, or you can console.log() something from inside your code. I like to use the console.log in order to see the return from a function if it won't be taking in a lot of different parameters, and write things in the console to test other inputs.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab lets you see the breakdown of HTML/CSS. This allows you to make quick changes to your HTML/CSS to see what changing/removing/moving a certain element will do to your page without having to change windows or save.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

You can use breakpoints or debuggers. Those are good ways to test specific sections of your code, and to see exactly what's happening during the executin of those sections.
