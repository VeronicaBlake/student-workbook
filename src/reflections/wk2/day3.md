## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The main ways to write information on a console are: 
- Using console.log(): this is a useful style to use when you want to check the output of a function so that you can see if there's been an error in the code. I guess it's probably best to use this if there is a single, specific instance that is being tested. 

- The other main way is to type into the console itself. This is useful when you want to call a function to see what it does under specific circumstances, or if you want to make a change to something that has been called and see what happens. If a lot of experimentation is required, this might be the way to go by interacting with the console tab.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML and CSS. This can be useful debugging your code because you can make quick changes to the code and see them reflected in the page quickly. And because none of it is permanent, you can just copy the changes you want to keep and discard the rest easily.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using breakpoints is a better way to debug your code than writing everything to the console. Breakpoints allow you to change the way that a single line of code interacts with the whole of the code, and can let you see the specific effects of what one part of the whole effects.
