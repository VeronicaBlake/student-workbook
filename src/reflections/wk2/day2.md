# Javascript Functions

Afternoon Challenge: https://github.com/VeronicaBlake/js-tests-loops-and-arrays

## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

Function Declaration: When using this method, the function is hoisted, allowing it to be invoked before it is defined.

Function Expressions: These are not hoisted, and must be defined before invoked.

Arrow Function Expression: Shorter syntax, create no 'this' value.

## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are the names created when the function is defined, arguments are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is invoked.

## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Higher-order functions take in another function as a parameter, or return a function. Array methods are higher-order functions. Neat!
