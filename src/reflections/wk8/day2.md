# Scrum for Small Teams

---

## Why is communication on a small team important?

Smaller teams don't have as many people to do work as larger teams do, so everyone needs to know what exactly it is they're responsible for. Communicating in the fastest, most effective way (not meeting/communicating too much or too little) is the best way to ensure that smaller teams know what they're doing, but can still get things done in a timely manner. This is one of the main ways the scrum methodology needs to be adapted for smaller teams.

## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Meetings need to be streamlined so that the smaller team can still have the time needed in order to meet deadlines. Stakeholders might need to make compromises on timelines or features (see the unattainable triangle). Sprints might need to be multi functional, and team members might need to stretch themselves in order to help the team meet the requirements that the project needs.
