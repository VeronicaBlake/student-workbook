# Testing in Vue and answer the following questions

---

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

-Unit Testing: allow you to test individual units of code in isolation. This gives developers confidence in their code.

-Component Testing: Test objects can be tested by themselves as a component, without integrating with other components. 

-End-To-End (E2E) Testing: what happens when users actually use your applications

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think that E2E is probably the most useful method of testing. Being able to mimic the user's experience is really useful, and gives a good idea of what you're working with in order to move forward or make any changes that might need to be made. Not to say the other methods of testing aren't useful, they're useful in other ways, but this just seems like the most comprehensive.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

If I have to choose one, I'm going to go with component testing. I struggle to say that it's the least useful, but its scope is awkward to me. You've got big picture with E2E and small steps with unit testing, and component testing is still useful in the sense that it breaks things down for testing, but in my opinion I would rather move forward with another one of the three methods discussed in the article.
