# An Honest Guide to Building a Powerful Developer Portfolio

## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
A developer Portfolio provides a space that you can use to show off specific aspects of yourself as a developer, and solid examples of those things. It's sort of like a skills resume, because all of these examples are bundled into one object that can be shared easily with others.

## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

A developer portfolio is effective when you can explain the specific meanings behind the pieces in them, and what each piece shows off which aspect of software development you're the most proud of. All of the pieces also should come together to paint a more complete picture of you as a developer, from page architecture to specific lines of code.

## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I would definitely include something like Kanban or Bugger in my portfolio, as well as the capstone we're working on right now. I think that something that reflects the best code I feel I can write (or something that starts off good and can be improved upon) to show potential employers a good sample of my work. I think that those two pieces are styled well on the front end and show some nice UX.
