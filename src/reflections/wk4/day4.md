## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REpresentational
State
Transfer

This means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource. I guess this means that you get specific information for a specific part of the requested resource. Usually in a Json form.

## What does Stateless mean?

This essentially means that the API won't remember anything about the user. Every individual request is asking for the same information (which seems a bit convoluted but I guess it's simpler than setting up local or cloud save states and storage).

## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

When writing a RESTful API, I think you use the CRUD pattern. I wasn't really able to discern an answer to this question using just the article, but that might just be me.
