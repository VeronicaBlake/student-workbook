# Async and Await

Afternoon Project:

## What is the purpose of Async/Await?

Async/Await were introduced to give better syntax to promises, which were introduced to solve callback hell. Async/Await make the asynchronous functions appear synchronous, although they still offer all the benefits that asynchronous coding and functions do.

## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

The client function must be defined as async, which means it will return a promise. This is what gives you the promise that is being awaited.

---

## What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

Some of the primary benefits of async/await are:

- The code is much simpler to read, which is better for everyone.
- Async functions can be chained easily (and are easy to read)
- Debugging is easier compared to just straight promises,
