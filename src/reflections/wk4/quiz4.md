# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

```
Asynchronous code waits on a promise from another part of the code to fire, synchronous just kind of does its own thing. one is conditional, and the other is not. 

```
**2.** What is an event listener?

```
An event listener is added on to an object in order to fire when a change is made to that object. It waits and listens for the object to change, and then makes the changes. 

```
