### Day 1: Intro, HR stuff, Environment Setup 

I'm going to try to do something like a retrospective with myself using this journal so that I can keep track of the roadblocks I hit and progress I make. So far, so good. I'm frantically trying to remember HTML and any Bootstrap knowledge I've forgotten, but I think I just need to get back into the swing of it. I'm rusty, no doubt. It's a very good thing that I'm starting from the beginning, because I need it. It sort of feels like being kicked all the way down to the bottom of the stairs when you can see the top step, but what are you going to do. 

#### My goals for take two of the course are: 
     - Timebox 10 minutes to work on a problem before seeking outside perspective 
     - Try not to bring the laptop up with questions (unless it's a syntax or debugging thing)
     - Journal for 10 minutes every day about how the day went (time limit is flexible)
     - Create a "concepts" study guide using Trello as a base 
     - Type notes in lecture as opposed to writing them by hand 

With these goals in mind, I really hope to make some drastic improvements in my effort put in to the course. I never want to be flailing around and lost and hopeless like I was before I had my breakdown, and that's going to require a decent amount of time and dedicated tasks that I can check off my to-do list, so those will need to be made daily as well. I'm also prioritizing my physical health (nutrition, hydration, sleep and exercise), so hopefully it will be easier to focus with more sleep and half the amount of rice crispy bars in me than before. Day 1!
