# Day 5- How I Feel and Other Stuff

https://github.com/VeronicaBlake/checkpoint1

This project did not go the way I wanted it to go, which is frustrating because I felt like I was really making progress up until I got to the media rule. I also realized I'm *real* bad at mobile first design. Oof.

I do feel like there were a lot of things that I knew how to do that I learned, which felt cool. Like I feel like my understanding of margins and padding is a lot better than it was on Tuesday. 

I have a deep dark fear that I'm not capable of learning fast enough for this course. I'll keep trying, but time will tell.
