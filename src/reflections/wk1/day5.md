## Day 1: Intro, HR stuff, Environment Setup

I'm going to try to do something like a retrospective with myself using this journal so that I can keep track of the roadblocks I hit and progress I make. So far, so good. I'm frantically trying to remember HTML and any Bootstrap knowledge I've forgotten, but I think I just need to get back into the swing of it. I'm rusty, no doubt. It's a very good thing that I'm starting from the beginning, because I need it. It sort of feels like being kicked all the way down to the bottom of the stairs when you can see the top step, but what are you going to do.

#### My goals for take two of the course are:

     - Timebox 10 minutes to work on a problem before seeking outside perspective
     - Try not to bring the laptop up with questions (unless it's a syntax or debugging thing)
     - Journal for 10 minutes every day about how the day went (time limit is flexible)
     - Create a "concepts" study guide using Trello as a base
     - Type notes in lecture as opposed to writing them by hand

With these goals in mind, I really hope to make some drastic improvements in my effort put in to the course. I never want to be flailing around and lost and hopeless like I was before I had my breakdown, and that's going to require a decent amount of time and dedicated tasks that I can check off my to-do list, so those will need to be made daily as well. I'm also prioritizing my physical health (nutrition, hydration, sleep and exercise), so hopefully it will be easier to focus with more sleep and half the amount of rice crispy bars in me than before. Day 1!

## Day 2: FlexBox be Flexin'

I hate flexbox. That's about all I got today. I got the coolsite made, and better than I did last time, but it still took me about two and a half hours and I abused margins and padding horrifically. And there are like five different classes that could have been consolidated into two, I'm almost positive. The code is in no way elegant, or pretty. However, do I want to start over and do it again? No.

Also, not to be "that kid" but when am I going to use this in the career field? We literally only used Bootstrap after we learned it. Although, I remember Mark telling me that the reason we learn Vanilla JS is so that we have a strong foundation when going into Node and other versions of JS, so that we have a little more insight under the hood when implementing those tools. Maybe it's like that? I bet it's like that actually. _ugh fine_ I'll relearn flexbox. But I won't be happy about it. Harrison just said that you can use media queries in flexbox so... maybe I'll try that.

Flexbox is much more infuriating than I remember it to be, however I think I'm definitely improving because I was able to actually get the site finished this go around, as opposed to the last time when I didn't figure out how to get sibling elements to be beside each other.Taking notes today went well, so I think I'll try to write them like I'm giving them to someone who is just learning the subject matter for the first time so that they're thorough and easy to read.

## Day 3

We made CSS stoplight for the morning challenge, and I was really happy with my code. Like, not just like "Oh, this is okay." I was like "This is some well written code." Which felt _awesome_. Granted it's just 5 elements on the page styled with flexbox, and I had to cannibalize my hover pseudo class from the stoplight I wrote before, but it still felt good. It was also different from Mark's, which was cool too. It felt like finding my own voice as a developer.

Getting my sea legs back with bootstrap was a bit rough, but I think that it will be a lot easier from here on out. I did kind of go MIA for a month and didn't get in a lot of practice during that time. Just have to take it slow, and try not to rush or get overwhelmed by the backlog of information and stress in my brain.

## Day 4

Partner programming continues to show me the value of working with others. Even on a problem that I'm confident I can solve, there are better and easier ways to approach them. Working with a partner that has a different style of communication is valuable as well, as it takes all kinds. (To do what exactly, I'm not sure, but it takes all kinds.)

This week has really hi-lighted how much I didn't know about Flexbox in particular, but it also made me realize how beneficial it will be to go through the course again. I'm already so much more efficient and at ease with Flexbox, it's awesome. And I now realize that flexbox is used in conjunction with Bootstrap, like always. Shows you my mental state by the end of my last cohort.

The amount of information that I just... didn't absorb the last time around is just crazy to me. Last time I was like a plastic plate getting glaze splashed on me, a little might have stuck but it was such a shallow and tenuous grasp it wasn't really there. This time I feel like an unglazed ceramic mug (why I'm a cup this time I'm not sure), and the information is sinking in. Maybe I really need to just relearn information frequently. This is something I've noticed with books, television, games, etc. The second time I do it, I'm like "Dude, how did I not see this last time?" Makes me feel optimistic about the rest of the course.
