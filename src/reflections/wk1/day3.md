## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

The most useful takeaway I got from this article is to consider how you want to make your users feel as they interact with the styling on your website. That's a visual rhetoric thing, and that's 100% my jam. Help users feel accomplished when they click the "checkout" button, make your site come across as trendy/elegant/modern/expensive, pressure customers into buying things on a timeline; there's so much you can do with how you communicate your ideas- from wording to colors to borders and font style.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Ok so I went on a tirade about this in my last journal, and I stand by all that. Unfortunately I can't remember everything I said, so let me tirade again.

Good design, encompassing your actual design and your UX and UI, is _imperative_ to your website's success. I don't know about you, but I'm not inclined to trust the security or validity of a website that looks like it was either:

1. made in 1999
   or
2. made by someone whose coding ability stops at basic html.

Who wants to give their credit card information to someone who can't google how to make a website look good?
Or even more nuanced, if your website is difficult to navigate, you risk frustrating users and alienating them. Good UX is something that you won't notice if it's done well, but if it's done poorly, it's like a blister on your heel whenever you try to take a step. And usually when you have a blister on your foot, the first thing that comes to mind is "I can't wait to get out of these shoes". Only your users aren't thinking about shoes, they're thinking "Forget this, I'll just go to another site that offers this good/service".

And then you've got no interaction, and that's a problem. Like that's _literally_ what the point of a website is: interaction. I'll spare you the rest because I feel like it's likely to get repetitive at this point, but I think you get the picture.
