## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
I think the tip that made me re-evaluate how I design is the tip that "not every button needs a background color". I usually would default to giving all buttons a color to differentiate them, but it really does unclutter the page and put emphasis on one option. And if color is really needed on the page, that can be added with text or a subtle boarder.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
I think design isn't noticeable if it's done well, but it sticks out a lot if it's done poorly. Especially on a mobile site. It's frustrating to be navigating a site that's designed poorly, and it personally makes me feel like the company is probably older, or doesn't care enough to re-evaluate their website. 
Good design is intuitive, and easy to navigate.

Things that can be conveyed through design are the manner of product that's being sold, or the "vibe" of the company. For instance a high-end furniture store will probably use a more minimalist design with muted or pastel colors, while a pop culture site might use brighter colors and a bolder typography. The demographic that the site is trying to appeal to can be gained from the visual rhetoric that's used in the design as well. Honestly I could probably write really in-depth about this but I won't subject you to that.
