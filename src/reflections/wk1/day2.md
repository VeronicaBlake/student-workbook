## What is a Pseudo-Class, and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A Pseudo-Class is a keyword added to an element in a specific state. They are triggered when a specific action (ie hovering, unclicked, clicked, etc ) or they meet criteria (ie only child, nth of type, visited link, etc). They are not technically classes, but act as such.

I know that :required is used quite frequently in modals, changing colors of links using :active seems like it might come in handy.

## What is Specificity, and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is the order that multiple rules will be applied to an element in the case that there are multiple rules in play on the same element. If you're writing CSS with a lot of children and parent elements, knowledge of specificity is going to save you a lot of heartache if something goes wrong, or if an element isn't behaving the way that you anticipate it should.

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

I have no idea how the program would anticipate which !important feature to execute first (maybe from top to bottom depending on what kind of language you're coding in). Over utilizing the !important feature will destroy all of the specificity that you've worked so hard to learn and utilize to your advantage.
