# Day 4 - Wire-framing: A Comprehensive Guide

## What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wireframing is essentially a rough draft of your website before any code is written. You can do different levels of detail (low fidelity is my favorite) to get your thoughts straight. It can be really useful for thinking out components, what needs to go where, what the margins and padding might be, what needs to be the same color, what's going to be a column and how bit it's going to be, etc.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

low, mid, and high fidelity wireframes are the different levels of detail. Low fidelity is useful when you've got a pen and paper, and maybe you just want to get some thoughts on the page. I find it really useful for mapping out page architecture.

Mid fidelity is nice to get something a little nicer, maybe you're not so concerned with the functionality yet, and you already have a good idea of what your pages are going to look like and what makes them up, so you want to focus on scaling, colors, etc.

A high fidelity mock is something good for presenting, and building out the flow of your project. If you've got to float an idea to a partner or a client, high fidelity is the best way to go.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Oh yea. Wireframes are good for collaboration, keeping your thoughts straight, and keeping track of progress and revision. Rough drafts are a must for other areas of creation, why should this be any different? Writers outline essays all the time, I assume scientists have a plan of action before they start an experiment, and a some third example. Coming back to a project and stepping out of the code is a good way to think about your UX and UI, and we already know how important I think those are.
