# Day 1 - Intro to Codeworks
What I learned in coding school is how to drive a boat.

## Why do we use Git?
Git is a useful tool because it allows multiple developers to work locally on code, and then push it to a remote server where others can comment and collaborate. So we use it because it's easy to collaborate on projects/get feedback/share our beautiful Git with the world.

## What are the benefits of using multiple branches? 
Multiple branches are beneficial because they allow the code to diverge in a way that is easily tracked. This allows for experimentation without having to make multiple new projects. Branches can be merged together later.

## What is the difference between Git and Github?
Git is a local repository, Github is a remote server that hosts Git and allows others to view or make changes to the Git. If Git is a train car, Github is the station. But the station is in the sky and everyone has their own train car that merges into a mega sky train when they're done. Ok that's a bad analogy.
