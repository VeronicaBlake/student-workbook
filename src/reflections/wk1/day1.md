## Why do we use Git?

We use git because it provides services like branches and merging, and it allows us to see the history of the edits that have been made. It also allows developers to each make a local copy of a remote repository. It's a neat tool.

## What are the benefits of using multiple branches? 

Multiple branches allow multiple devs to work on a project at the same time (as long as they stay out of each other's files it's fine), and they allow devs to have a branch outside of the one that's getting deployed to see everything coming together. Multiple branches are brilliant if used properly, but can really be a nightmare to fix if you make a merging mistake.

## What is the difference between Git and Github?

Github is a remote repository where multiple projects that use git can be stored and accessed remotely by multiple developers. Github is the container, Git is the marbles in the container. Only the marbles can go all over the world to anyone with a jar and an internet connection. Hm. I'll work on that metaphor.
